## ðŸ“Œ 3.0 Data Exploration

Before we dive into problem-solving, let's explore the data! We will develop a few hypotheses and test them using SQL.

### 3.1 Validating Data with Hypotheses

We will develop a few hypotheses and test them using SQL.

### 3.1.1 Hypothesis 1
> The number of unique `inventory_id` records will be equal in both `dvd_rentals.rentals` and `dvd_rentals.inventory` tables.

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT inventory_id) -- As there are multiple inventory_id for each film_id, run DISTINCT to find unique inventory_id
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
````

<img width="83" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129328891-baee9de2-1d49-422a-a10b-9d15b61a70a6.png">

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(inventory_id)
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory;
````
<img width="91" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129328941-190879ee-18c4-47c8-94ac-bcd5b43c5575.png">

Looks like there are 4,580 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.rentals` and 4,581 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.inventory`. There is an additional 1 `inventory_id` record in `dvd_rentals.inventory`. 

### 3.1.2 Hypothesis 2
> There will be a multiple records per unique `inventory_id` in the `dvd_rentals.rental` table.

````sql
WITH inventory_cte AS ( -- Generate a CTE using GROUP BY count of inventory_id
SELECT 
  inventory_id, 
  COUNT(*) AS inventory_id_count
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
GROUP BY inventory_id)
````

<img width="299" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129329083-786a002c-c5c5-4e46-9e44-5c2b6e80d207.png">

The table above shows the number of inventory records for each unique `inventory_id`. Then, we create a `CTE` and perform another grouping below.

````sql
SELECT 
  inventory_id_count,
  COUNT(*) AS inventory_id_grouping
FROM inventory_cte
GROUP BY inventory_id_count
ORDER BY inventory_id_count;
````

<img width="367" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129329125-c5c69fc4-e2c4-46df-b110-beb7a660cb30.png">

Ok, `inventory_id_count` represents the number of inventory records for each film and `inventory_id_grouping` is `inventory_id_count` grouped by the number of records.

For example, in 1st row, there is 1 inventory_id/ film that has 4 copies of inventory/film.

### 3.1.3 Hypothesis 3
> There will be multiple `inventory_id` records per unique `film_id` value in the `dvd_rentals.inventory` table

````sql
WITH inventory_grouped AS (
SELECT 
  DISTINCT(film_id) AS unique_film_id, 
  COUNT(*) AS inventory_records_count
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory
GROUP BY film_id)
````

<img width="291" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129327670-a840f098-45fd-4851-a1ec-5d00d4336e0a.png">

````sql
SELECT 
  inventory_records_count, 
  COUNT(*)
FROM inventory_grouped
GROUP BY inventory_records_count
ORDER BY inventory_records_count;
````

<img width="283" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129329569-20591e56-d705-4dad-bfc0-d9c554b33ce3.png">

### 3.2 Foreign Key Overlap Analysis

### 3.2.1 Rental and Inventory Table
Let's revisit the following findings,

> "Looks like there are 4,580 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.rentals` and 4,581 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.inventory`. There is an additional 1 `inventory_id` record in `dvd_rentals.inventory`."

We will perform an ANTI JOIN on `dvd_rentals.inventory` to find out what is the additional record.

First, let's confirm our hypothesis one more time.

````sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT i.inventory_id)
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory AS i
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT r.inventory_id
  FROM dvd_rentals.rental AS r
  WHERE i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id);
````

<img width="112" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129332739-6d11213d-06f2-4b31-a72e-1473a4dab1f9.png">

````sql
SELECT
  *
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory AS i
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT r.inventory_id
  FROM dvd_rentals.rental AS r
  WHERE i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id);
````

<img width="772" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129332786-0f2ee64f-cfee-4206-96b7-5c9e500e64e4.png">

We can make our assumption that this specific film is never rented by any customer, that's why it did not exist in the `rental` table which records only rental transactions.

</summary>
  
The following SQL skills and concepts will be covered in this section of the Serious SQL course:

1. Learning how to interpret ERDs for data literacy and business context (entity-relationship diagrams)
- Identify key columns of interest and how they are linked to other tables via foreign keys
- Use ERDs to analyze the data types for different columns in database tables
- Understand data context for various tables that cause inherent natural relationships between fields

2. Introduction to all types of table joining operations
- Simple joins: left, inner
- More involved joins: cross, anti, left-semi, full outer
- Combination set operations: union, union all, intersect, except

3. Practical application of table joins
- Joining multiple tables to combine disparate datasets into a single data structure
- Joining interim SQL outputs for more advanced group-by, split, merge data hacking strategies
- Performing table joins that use 2 or more table references in the ON condition
- Using anti joins to exclude records in a sequential fashion

4. Filtering, window functions and aggregates for analytics and ranking
- Using ROW_NUMBER to effecively rank order records with equal ties
- Using WHERE filters to extract ranked records
- Using multiple aggregate functions with different target partitions and ordering expressions for efficient data analysis
- Using aggregate group by clauses to generate unique customer level insights

5. Case statements for data transformation and manipulation
- Pivoting datasets from long to wide using MAX and CASE WHEN
- Manipulating actual data values using conditional logic for business translation purposes

6. SQL scripting basics
- Designing SQL workflows which can be easily understood and implemented
- Managing multiple dependencies for downstream table joining operations by using temporary tables to store interim datasets

7. Manipulating text data
- Converting text columns to title case
- Combining multiple text and numeric data type columns into a single text expression
