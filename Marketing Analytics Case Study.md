The following SQL skills and concepts will be covered in this section of the Serious SQL course:

1. Learning how to interpret ERDs for data literacy and business context (entity-relationship diagrams)
- Identify key columns of interest and how they are linked to other tables via foreign keys
- Use ERDs to analyze the data types for different columns in database tables
- Understand data context for various tables that cause inherent natural relationships between fields

2. Introduction to all types of table joining operations
- Simple joins: left, inner
- More involved joins: cross, anti, left-semi, full outer
- Combination set operations: union, union all, intersect, except

3. Practical application of table joins
- Joining multiple tables to combine disparate datasets into a single data structure
- Joining interim SQL outputs for more advanced group-by, split, merge data hacking strategies
- Performing table joins that use 2 or more table references in the ON condition
- Using anti joins to exclude records in a sequential fashion

4. Filtering, window functions and aggregates for analytics and ranking
- Using ROW_NUMBER to effecively rank order records with equal ties
- Using WHERE filters to extract ranked records
- Using multiple aggregate functions with different target partitions and ordering expressions for efficient data analysis
- Using aggregate group by clauses to generate unique customer level insights

5. Case statements for data transformation and manipulation
- Pivoting datasets from long to wide using MAX and CASE WHEN
- Manipulating actual data values using conditional logic for business translation purposes

6. SQL scripting basics
- Designing SQL workflows which can be easily understood and implemented
- Managing multiple dependencies for downstream table joining operations by using temporary tables to store interim datasets

7. Manipulating text data
- Converting text columns to title case
- Combining multiple text and numeric data type columns into a single text expression
