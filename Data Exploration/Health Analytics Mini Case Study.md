### To answer Q2 to Q8, we create a temporary table.

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count;

CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_count AS(
SELECT
  id,
  COUNT(*) AS measure_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT measure) AS unique_measure_count
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY id);
````

### 2. How many total measurements do we have per user on average?

Question asks to find for the **average number of measurements for all users**.

````sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(measure_count),2) AS avg_measurement
FROM user_measure_count;
````

**Answer:**

### 3. What about the median number of measurements per user?

````sql
SELECT 
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY measure_count) AS median_value
FROM user_measure_count;
````
**Answer:**

### 4. How many users have 3 or more measurements?

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 3
````
**Answer:**

### 5. How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 1000
````
**Answer:**

### Looking at the logs data -
### 6. What is the number and percentage of the active user base who have logged blood glucose measurements?

````sql
SELECT
  measure,
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS unique_blood_glucose_user,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT id)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT id)) OVER (),2) AS blood_glucose_percentage
FROM health.user_logs
GROUP BY measure;
````
**Answer:**

### 7. What is the number and percentage of the active user base who have at least 2 types of measurements?

````sql
WITH measure_more_than_2 AS (
SELECT *
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measure_count >= 2)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) AS unique_user,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT u.id),2) AS unique_user_percentage
FROM user_measure_count AS u
LEFT JOIN measure_more_than_2 AS m
  ON u.id = m.id;
````

**Answer:**

Out of 554 active users, 204 users have at least 2 types of measurements making up 37% of total active user base.

### 8. What is the number and percentage of the active user base who have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?

````sql
WITH all_measures AS (
SELECT *
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measure_count = 3) -- Filter results with users with all 3 measures

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) AS unique_user,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT m.id)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT u.id),2) AS unique_user_percentage
FROM user_measure_count AS u
LEFT JOIN all_measures AS m -- Use left join to get results with all records in user_measure_count table and intersect with all_measures `CTE`
  ON u.id = m.id;
````
